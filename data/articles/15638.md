Here are a number of ways you could commit to reflecting on your experiences:

* Keep a service reflection journal
* Raise the issue of the importance of ongoing reflection to my group
* Offer to lead group reflection sessions
* When you have a question or a situation that disturbs me, raise it to the group
* When someone else is leading reflection, be a thoughtful, attentive and active participant
