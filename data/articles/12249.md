## Tips for Working in the Community

Working in the community is an opportunity to cross both visible and invisible boundaries that exist in society. Collaborating with others with whom you begin as an “outsider” (when you are not a member of that community) is a complex situation to navigate. Without understanding one's personal privilege and power, difficult and harmful situations may arise when Tufts community members engage with community members of differing cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, histories, and lived experiences.  Even if you are of the same background of the community members you are partnering with, as a Tufts student you may be seen as representing the institution of Tufts, along with its power and privilege.

Awareness of these issues, understanding yourself in this context, and coming from a place of humility are all ways to begin true collaboration.
