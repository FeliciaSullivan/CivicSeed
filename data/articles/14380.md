## Academic Connections

It is important for you to think about the connections between your academic courses and the work you are doing in the community. You may refer back to knowledge gained in a course when working in a community to increase your efficacy; you also may use the practical experience gained through civic engagement to increase your understand of theory taught in the classroom. Theory informs practice and practice informs theory: it is circular.  Consider being intentional when selecting courses in thinking about a wide range of connections.
