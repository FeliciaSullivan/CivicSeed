## Key Points about Social Identities by Diane Goodman, University of Massachusetts

* We all have social identities and culture
* Our social identities affect our values, world views, beliefs, and behaviors
* Our mix of social identities helps define who we are and how we experience the world
* There may be aspects of our social identities and cultures that we appreciate and that we find difficult
* We can appreciate our differences from others (not only our commonalities)
* Difference does not mean deficient

Exploring issues of social identities and differences can be challenging. When working with others who are have similar backgrounds as you, mutual understanding often occurs without much effort. When collaborating with others of other races, socioeconomic classes, religions, cultures, sexual orientations, values and other differences, it is important to be aware of these issues and be active in working towards mutual understanding. You are encouraged to continue working on this beyond Civic Seed.

Our goal is to learn from the diverse people with whom we interact, reserve judgment, and bridge the cultural divide between perspectives in order to develop and maintain mutual respect and a collaborative working relationship.

__This is a lifelong process and intensive work, not completed through an online learning tool. This will hopefully serve as an introduction and inspiration for you to continue exploring your own identity and these issues, not just in the context of your community work, but in society as a whole.__

Power dynamics that arise as result of differences when working in a community will be discussed more in Part 3.
