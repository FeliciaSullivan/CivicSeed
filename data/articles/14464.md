## Shared Goals and Objective

Before beginning your community project, it is important that you understand the goals the community organization has for your project. If you are working on an individual project or you are the student leader of a group program or project, it is up to you to talk with your community partner to articulate these clearly so that you have a mutual understanding, and then communicate this to your group members.

If you are a member of a larger student group and the goals have not been made clear, talk to the community partner or student leader. There will most likely be concrete goals/objectives expected by the community organization.

Examples include:

* a series of visits for high school students to the Tufts campus
* a health fair for immigrant families
* a weekly reading program for preschoolers

There may also be educational goals that the community organization has for you that are also beneficial for their advocacy on an issue. Examples include:

* Building your knowledge of homelessness in the U.S.
* Increasing your understanding of the challenges facing immigrant families

### Remember your own goals and objectives

There should be some duplication, and some individuation. Above all, however, the community goals of your project, which should be mutually agreed upon, need to be accomplished within the agreed upon time frame.
