What are the differences between goals and objectives? This is confusing to many people, and often used interchangeably, although by definition they are quite different. Thereâ€™s no need to worry about this too much now, but it may be helpful to you to understand. Basically, goals are expansive and objectives are specific.

Examples of a personal goal and objective:

__GOAL:__ Become more aware of educational disparities in immigrant communities.

__OBJECTIVE:__ Provide children in an ESL classroom with an afterschool program that increases their homework completion.
