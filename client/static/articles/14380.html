    <h2>Academic Connections</h2>
    <p>
      It is important for you to think about the connections between your academic courses and the work you are doing in the community. You may refer back to knowledge gained in a course when working in a community to increase your efficacy; you also may use the practical experience gained through civic engagement to increase your understand of theory taught in the classroom. Theory informs practice and practice informs theory: it is circular.  Consider being intentional when selecting courses in thinking about a wide range of connections.
