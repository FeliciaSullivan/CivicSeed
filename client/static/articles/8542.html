			Consider this statement written by Sonia Nieto, Professor Emerita of Language, Literacy and Culture at the School of Education, University of Massachusetts, Amherst:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			“There is a feeling of <em>nobless oblige</em> in [much] community service, of doing something to feel righteous.  [We need to] challenge the perception of community service as charity, replacing it with the notion of civic responsibility in a pluralistic but unequal society…Those who do community service at colleges and universities are generally young people who have more advantages than those they are serving. This being the case, concerns about racism and other biases, injustice, oppression, and unearned privilege should figure prominently in discussions of community service…”
