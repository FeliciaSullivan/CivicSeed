      Here are a number of ways you could commit to reflecting on your experiences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep a service reflection journal</li>
      <li>Raise the issue of the importance of ongoing reflection to my group</li>
      <li>Offer to lead group reflection sessions</li>
      <li>When you have a question or a situation that disturbs me, raise it to the group</li>
      <li>When someone else is leading reflection, be a thoughtful, attentive and active participant</li>
    </ul>
