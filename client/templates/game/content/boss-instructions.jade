h3 How to play
p This is the basement of my lab. The <strong class='color-darkorange'>Charging Modules</strong> <img src='#{CivicSeed.CLOUD_PATH}/img/game/boss/charger.png'> are hidden somewhere here.  To find the charging modules, you’ll need to use the <strong class='color-darkgreen'>Special Seeds</strong> you earned.  These special seeds can detect and reveal the charging modules. Whenever you plant one, the color bursts will be <strong>darker</strong> the <strong>closer</strong> it is to a charging module. It will help guide the way!
p Once you reveal a charging module, you have to <strong>walk over to it</strong>, and disable it by hand. Find all four to shut down the robot!  You might also find some of my other inventions down here. These can give you more <strong class='color-darkgreen'>seeds <img src='#{CivicSeed.CLOUD_PATH}/img/game/boss/thing1.png'></strong>, or more <strong class='color-darkblue'>time <img src='#{CivicSeed.CLOUD_PATH}/img/game/boss/thing2.png'></strong>. Watch out for the <strong class='color-red'>red potion <img src='#{CivicSeed.CLOUD_PATH}/img/game/boss/thing3.png'></strong> which can erase your progress, or the <strong class='color-darkorange'>watch <img src='#{CivicSeed.CLOUD_PATH}/img/game/boss/thing4.png'></strong> that speeds up the timer. If you run out seeds, or run out of time, you’ll have to try again.
