		h2 How To Play
		.helpContent.overlayContent
			p The goal of the game is to fully color return color to the world, which starts in grayscale. To do this, you must explore, talk to the Calliopeans you see, answer their questions, plant seeds, and find research to complete new seed recipes.

			h3 The Game Display
			p You can see and interact with the game through your display. This consists of the view screen, the Status Bar, and the Display Icons.

			h3 The View Screen
			p This shows you the portion of the world you are in, along with any other characters that are in the same location. At the upper right hand corner of the map, you can see a mini map. All players, including you, appear on the mini map as little white dots. The mini-map tells you roughly where you are in the world. The large white block near the center of the mini map represents the Botanist's Garden. You must return here at the end of each level to solve the puzzle.

			h3 The Status Bar
			p Beneath the view screen, you can see the status bar. This tells you useful information, like what level you're on, when you've entered a new area of the world, and when other players interact with you. The Status Bar can be converted into a chat box by clicking the speech bubble icon in the display.

			h3 The Icons
			p The seven display icons each have unique functions.
			ul.fa-ul
				li <i class='fa-li fa fa-briefcase fa-lg'></i> <strong>Toolbox:</strong> Open and close your inventory
				li <i class='fa-li fa fa-leaf fa-lg'></i> <strong>Leaf:</strong> Enter or exit seed mode
				li <i class='fa-li fa fa-globe fa-lg'></i> <strong>Globe:</strong> Toggle mini map off and on
				li <i class='fa-li fa fa-desktop fa-lg'></i> <strong>Computer Screen:</strong> Show your progress. You can view your seed-planting, other players' planting, review your answers, and see who's in the lead.
				li <i class='fa-li fa fa-volume-up fa-lg'></i> <strong>Speaker:</strong> Turn music on or off
				li <i class='fa-li fa fa-question-circle fa-lg'></i> <strong>Question Mark:</strong> Launch help document

			h3 Exploring The World
			p To move your character, click anywhere on the screen. Your cursor will appear as a green box if it's possible to move there. If it's not possible to move there, the box will turn red.

			h3 Interacting With Characters and Answering Questions
			p To interact with characters you see, click on that character. This opens up a dialogue box. Most characters will ask you a question and reward you with seeds and puzzle pieces for a right answer, but some share game pointers or offer other observations. When you answer questions correctly, you are rewarded with seeds. If the question was multiple choice, you receive fewer seeds for each wrong answer you submit, so read carefully!
			p By default, your answers are private. You can make them public by clicking the “make public” button next to your answer. An “unlock” icon will appear, indicating that others can read your answer. If you accidentally make an answer public, you can make it private again by clicking the “unlock” icon that appears.

			h3 Planting Seeds
			p To plant a seed, click the leaf icon at the bottom of your display. This puts you in “Seed-Planting Mode.” While you are in Seed-Planting Mode, you can plant a seed by clicking anywhere in the world. A patch of color the same shade as your character will appear. You just brought some color back to the world! To exit seed mode and resume exploring, click the leaf icon again.

			h3 Paintbrush Seeds
			p Most characters reward you with normal seeds, but the Botanist gives you Paintbrush Seeds which allow you to plant color in custom shapes. If you have any Paintbrush Seeds, clicking the leaf icon brings up a menu of three choices. Click the leftmost icon to plant normal seeds. Plant the middle icon to plant Paintbrush Seeds. The rightmost icon is a mystery you'll have to uncover as you play and explore.

			h3 Interacting With Other Players
			p There are two ways you can interact with other players in the game. The first way is to chat with them. If you see another player (they'll look just like you, but in a different color) you can chat with them. To do this, click on the speech bubble icon. This transforms the status bar into a chat box. Type your message and hit the “enter” key to chat. Clicking the speech bubble icon again exits chat mode.

			h3 Seed It!
			p You can also grant bonus seeds to your fellow players. After you answer a question, you'll see all answers that have been made public. If you like another player's answer, click “Seed it!” to grant them a bonus seed. This bonus seed does not come from your supply, it's a bonus seed awarded for excellent answers. These bonus seeds are always mega seeds. You may award up to five bonus seeds to other players each level, and you may award multiple bonus seeds to one response if you feel so inclined.

			h3 Completing the Recipes
			p The Botanist's notebook contains four recipes for Paintbrush Seeds, which correspond with the four levels of the game. Each recipe also includes a special puzzle. As you explore the world and answer questions, you'll earn research pieces, in addition to seeds, which you will use to answer solve the puzzle.
			p When you think you have enough research pieces to solve the puzzle, return to the Botanist. He will show you the outline of the puzzle. You can then drag pieces from your inventory onto the puzzle. The text of the recipe appears next to the puzzle. Look at the text for hints!
			p As long as there are any wrong pieces on the board, you cannot solve the riddle. To remove a puzzle piece from the board, drop it into the trash.
			p When you think you've correctly solved the riddle, hit “Answer.” If you're correct, you progress to the next level, and earn some Paintbrush Seeds. For each time you answer incorrectly, you will receive less and less seeds. After you complete all four levels, the game is complete and you unlock your civic resume!

			h3 Your Inventory
			p Every time you answer a question correctly, you gain a research piece. You can view the pieces you've collected at any time by clicking the toolbox icon on your display. From here, you can view the resources again by clicking the puzzle pieces,

			h3 Your Profile: A Civic Resume
			p After each level, you will be prompted to fill in a section of your civic resume. At the end of the game, your resume is unlocked, enabling you to use it as a public tool for civic engagement. This lets everyone know that you have completed Civic Seed, and are certified by Tufts to engage with their host communities. It also lets organizations and the people you'll work with understand you better, so your goals can be aligned.
