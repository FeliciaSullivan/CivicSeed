# Updating tilesheets

(Work in progress)
#### Data

* Download [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) Map Editor.
* Export tile data from Tiled as JSON format.
* Drop the JSON into the `data` folder in the CivicSeed repository.

#### Images

* Get a tilesheet
* Make a gray version of it by using Photoshop. Using the original, desaturate the image completely with `Shift-Command-U`. Next, normalize the whites by using the Levels command (`Command-L`), selecting the white dropper, and clicking on any of the white borders around the objects. The image should get slightly lighter. Save this as `tilesheet_gray.png`.
